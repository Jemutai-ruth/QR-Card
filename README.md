## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The most challenging part was choosing the right CSS properties but in the end I managed to use My best judgement and got the above results. Patience and trusting yourself are some of the things that you'll need to do this especially if you are a begineer like me. Overall it was an exciting experience and a wonderful learning opportunity.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');

body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}

.card{     
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding-top: 100px;
}

.card-content{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); 
    border-radius:10px;     
    padding: 10px; 
    width: 255px;
    height: 410px;
    text-align:center; 
    
}
```



### Continued development

I would love to continue focusing on improving my CSS properties editing skills.



### Useful resources

- [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me understand some CSS basic concepts, I'd recommend it for begginers interested in learning CSS.
